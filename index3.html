    <h3 class="wtd">Web developers develop websites, specifically by creating the site’s code, connecting it to a server and maintaining its accessibility to users.

        Web development is responsible for creating the sites and applications we use through a web browser in our day-to-day lives. Web developers, often working in teams or alongside other tech professionals like data scientists, UX designers and product managers, use specialized techniques and a thorough knowledge of one or more programming languages to create a foundation for where the website’s database will live, known as a back-end. 
        
        The back-end is dependent upon the website’s server, which stores web pages and applications to be loaded into the web browser upon request.  The server acts as an intermediary between the web page or application and the data stored within the server, facilitating communication between the database and the client.
        
        Web developers are also responsible for creating the front-end of a website through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which creates the layout and style that the user sees and interacts with when using the site.
        
        Finally, web developers are responsible for maintaining the site's functionality and overall performance over time.</h3><br>
